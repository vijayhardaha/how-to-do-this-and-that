# How to do This and That

This is a documentation repositary for things that I learn and forget quickly and after some times I smash my head and keyboard finding **How to do it again?**. I am pretty sure, this will help me and others in future or maybe it's another public github repositary that no one visits until I delete it ðŸ˜‚
